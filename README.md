# Train Scheduler

### The idea behind this app was to use a table format with user input to create a train scheduler where it'll give the user info on:

+ Train Name
+ Destination
+ Frequency of trains
+ Next Train Arrival
+ Minutes Away

### The idea was to use momentjs to display time and add the minutes from real time to next arrival time based on frequency minutes.

### Technologies/Libraries used:

+ Bootstrap
+ jQuery
+ Moment JS
+ Firebase
